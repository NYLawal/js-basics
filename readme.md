6. Statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time and require the declaration of the data types of variables before they are used, while dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time and do not require the declaration of the data types of variables before they are used. 
In static typing, types are associated with variables, while in dynamic typing, types are associated with values. Examples of statically typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, FORTRAN, Pascal etc. Examples of dynamically typed languages are Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Groovy, Lisp, Prolog etc.

7. Null is an assigned value which means nothing, while undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet. In other words, null indicates "nothing" or "empty", while undefined indicates a variable without a value.
In JavaScript, undefined is a type, whereas null is an object. 'Undefined' means a variable is declared, but no value has been assigned. Whereas, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable.
